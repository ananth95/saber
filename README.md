=====

Usage
-----
```sh
bash ./launch.sh
```
Now go to `arena/logs` to see the logs generated by this game. `json` output is not implemented as it is easy and will anyways have to be completely re-written for the actual game. Refer the wiki for any doubts, specifically [this](wiki/Bots-and-Game-Specs). Open an [issue](https://github.com/arrow-/saber/issues/new) if wiki is not clear or missing information.

Other *(interesting only)* stuff that you can do:
> Test `quantum.py`
```sh
python quantum.py
```
> To run a bot standalone,
```sh
python bots/<bot_name>.py
```

TODO
----

login and team formation, use Niranjan's `gist`

> *But we still need a name for the game!*

* Rule specification needs to be ready.
* The [wiki](wiki) is up and running. Any long explanations must end up there.

Sandboxing and Communication
----------------------------

Sorta solved. It's insecure, and will probably remain so. In that case, we'll have to proof-read the submitted source code.

Game Engine and Resource Manager
--------------------------------

Invokes a round that procures resources from a pool. If a simple count of **threads-in-use** and **total-mem-used** is enough to avoid exceeding resource use (this can happen at peak time when `N` users need to run their game).

Sample Bots
-----------

Map Creation
------------

`map_util.py` must be used to generate the maps. It's got a simple, intuitive interface.
```sh
python map_util.py
```

Leaderboards

The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/arrow-/saber_frontend). The `Game_ui` folder has the Javascript/HTML5 game.
