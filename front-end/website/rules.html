        <p>First and foremost, you agree that decisions made by the event managers pertaining to hosting, running, administering the tournaments will be final, and binding.
        And,</p>
        <ul>
        <li> <i>You promise to not indulge in malpractice and ensure that your bot (submitted computer program) conforms to <a href="specs.html#user_decl">$%$ these specifications $%$</a>. If you fail to do so and are discovered, you will be banned and removed from the competition and the leaderboard on the discretion of the event managers.</i></li>
        <li>In case you suspect a bug in the game-engine, you will use the <a href="broken">```issue tool```</a> provided so that we can review and resolve the problem.</li>
        <li><i>You must provide proof that you are an enrolled student at your institute by uploading a photo of your Institute ID Card, and any other identification documents as we require from you TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PRIZES. Your bot WILL FEATURE on the leaderboard nevertheless.</i></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will provide you template code in all the three supported languages, C, C++, python and an API to affect your in-game-decisions in a turn based manner. You will not have to worry about input and output formatting as well as game-state parsing.
        You can test your bot against a few sample bots that we provide so you can feel the heat of the real-deal that your bot will handle in the finale.</p>

        <p>Reach us out in case of any clarifications on the game-engine or administration and we'll be happy to assist you!
